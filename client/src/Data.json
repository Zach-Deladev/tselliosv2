    "subtitle": "A Legacy of K9 Mastery",
    "text": "Our journey started over 10 years ago when we started breeding, training, and selling dogs for the Greek police and for dog sport enthusiasts. We then slowly started competing ourselves within the I.G.P. <br />Our quest and hunger to be the best led us in 2020 to undertake Ivan Balabanov's TWC (training without conflict) certification program where our whole outlook on dog training was completely transformed, we then started seeing everything more holistically. Our approach to dog training and dogs themselves, in general, is completely different than other approaches because of this experience. We specialize in the proper upbringing of puppies and we are very big on things being done the right way from the first moment to avoid problems down the line. With that in mind, In 2022 we started our own training business and Belgian Malinois breeding program under the name of Tsellios K9 Academy.",
